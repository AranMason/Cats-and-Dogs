# Keras Deep Learning API

This repo is my playground for experiementing with Keras and learning my way around the library.

NOTE: Keras version 2.1.6 is being used over later version due to issues saving and loading models.

## Current Learning Goals

### Flask
- Create a Image Recognition Model
	- Currently transfer-learning with VGG16
- Create a Simple Web API and Interface to interface with the Model

## Reference Material
- [Keras.io](https://keras.io/)
